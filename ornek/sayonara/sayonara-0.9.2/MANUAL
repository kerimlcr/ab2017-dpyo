==============================================================================================

== Menubar ==

       File:
		* Open File: Select one or multiple files you want to play
	
                * Open Folder: Select folders to play
		
                * Import Folder: Select a folder that should be imported to library 
                               and optionally copied to a user specified path in library
                               You can choose if this folder should be copied. 
                               Recommended: activate this option
                
                * Reload Library: Reload your library if you did any changes not within
                                  the player (e.g. extern id3 editors, or deleted files)
                                  All tracks in your library folder will be checked again.
                
                * Fetch all covers: Will fetch all covers for all your albums.
                                    This is only necessary, if you are offline sometimes
                                    because single cover fetching is pretty fast


        View:
		* Library: switch from compact mode to extended mode
                
                * Small playlist items: You will see more of your tracks in the playlist
                
                * LastFM radio (Extension): Only available if LastFM is activated
                
                * Stream (Extension) Custom radio station (you also can save them)
                
                * Equalizer: An graphical 10-band equalizer
                
                * Playlists: Save your favorite playlist
                
                * Notifications: Show notification if player changes
                
                * Close to tray: Sayonara won't be minimized, it will be closed to the
                                 System tray. You can click on the system tray icon to reopen 
                                 it
                
                * Dark skin: Darken sayonara (but this does not look that well atm)


        Preferences:
                * LastFM: (de)activate LastFM and type your user credentials. You also can switch
                          if LastFM should show you id3 corrections (there will be a little "ID3" 
                          Icon in the player then, if necesary)

                * Streamripper: Activate or deactivate streamripper. If activated, a record button 
                                will appear instead of the pause button. If you only want to store 
                                entire LastFM tracks and not only parts of them if you forwarded them,
                                you should choose this option. For single radio streams deactivate this 
                                option. Otherwise there would be no result. In future, streamripper 
                                also will create a playlist of your recorded tracks. The folder where 
                                all the tracks will go is not imported to library. You can do this 
                                manually.


=== Player ===

        * The stars indicate bitrate quality of your file (just check out the tooltip)

        * If LastFM id3 corrections are activated the player shows you a little id3 button next to the 
          title, if your id3 tags are not correct

        * If streamripper is activated there will be a record button instead of the play / pause button.
          If you press the button too late, it's no problem. You will get the entire track nevertheless. 
          *** IMPORTANT *** The record button the button must be activated before you click the stop 
          button or the stream ends

        * Click on the cover if you want to have your own picture. You can specify any search term there.
          The cover will be shown for all tracks with this artist/album combination.

        * Click on the loudspeaker icon for mute/unmute

        * In LastFM streams you cannot move the progress bar

        * Everything else should be clear


=== Playlist ===

        * You can drag and drop from your desktop, file-manager, library, within playlist

        * You can delete tracks by marking them (you also can select multiple tracks with Ctrl-key) 
          and press the delete button on your keyboard

        * Right click on a track or multiple tracks will allow you to edit these tracks, show the 
          lyrics or just information

        * You can not mix up www-streams and library tracks yet!

        * If there are tracks the library does not know, a litte icon will appear in the upper right 
          that will allow you to import tracks to library, so you can search for them. 
          THE TRACKS WON'T BE COPIED TO YOUR LIBRARY FOLDER! If you want so use the 
          "File->Import Folder" or "File->reload library" instead.

        * There are four buttons at the bottom: Repeat, shuffle, dynamic and append
          For repeat and shuffle please have a look at the manual of your discman.

        * Dynamic means that the player will automatically insert a new track at the bottom of the 
          playlist, that matches the music taste. This track will come from your library. So don't 
          wonder if it is not working and your library is only 5 tracks big. 
          *** IMPORTANT *** This feature is only available if you are logged in to LastFM

        * Append means, that if you choose "Open track" or "Open folder" or double click anything in 
          the library that it will be appended to the current playlist. Else your playlist will be 
          cleared and substituted with new tracks

        * Everything else should be clear


=== Library ===

        * Double click clears the playlist and will insert the chosen tracks, albums or artists if the 
          append button in playlist is not checked. Otherwise these tracks will be appended at the end 
          of your playlist

        * You can drag and drop to playlist

        * Right click should be clear
 
        * Middle click will insert this track / album / artist after the current played track in 
          playlist. Functionality is the same as right click->play next

        * If you chose an artist or album and you want to undo it click the clear button or alter the 
          searchstring

        * You can search by fulltext (searches in artists/albums/title), filesystem path or genre.
          HINT: if you dont want to click on the drop down every time just type "f:", "p:" or "g:" at 
          the beginning of your search term. So search mode will change as indicated in the drop down 
          menu.

        * If you don't like some tracks/albums/artists delete them. But make sure you press the "only
          from library" button. If you really hate them deactivate this function. Tracks will be lost
          forever then.

        * Everything else should be clear.



=== ID3 Tag editor ===

        * You can edit your ID3 Data. The "all" checkboxes will apply it to all tracks loaded by the
          ID3 tag editor. Sometimes the artists, albums, genres... SHOULD differ. So be careful with
          this checkbox

        * In the next version you can extract your metadata from filepath. It is implemented but the
          player crashes when saving files. I have to overview it...

	* You can set genres and find tracks via the search functionality in library

        * Everything else should be clear


=== LastFM ===

        * Many functions depend of LastFM. The dynamic play button in playlist, the ID3 corrections in
          the player, LastFM radio.. So create an account and enjoy a lot of additional functionality

        * For the first two functionalities have a look at the section "Playlist" respectively "Player"

        * There are 4 options for radio: Artist, tag, user radio and recommended.
          Artist: play songs that are similar to the artists songs. Type an artist
          Tag: play songs that match the tag (e.g. death metal). Type a genre
          User radio: Choose one of your friends or yourself if she or he has great music taste and enjoy
                      her or his sound
          Recommended: Choose on of your friends or bla bla and enjoy sound that is recommended for this
                       user

        * If stream recorder is active it will create a folder for artist and create a tagged MP3 file for
          each of the played tracks. Make sure the record button is pressed when the track stops or changes
          otherwise the track will NOT be saved.

        * You cannot use the progress bar because of LastFM restrictions.

        * Everything else should be clear.


=== Streams === 

        * Choose a pls or m3u playlist or some soundfile from the internet and type it there. Click on listen
          Tadaaa!

        * Sometimes it does not work. Choose another one
        
        * If you like this station you can save it.
