stations.  42 is Douglas Adams' Answer to Life, the Universe and
Everything in book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Life is
finite.  The Universe is infinite.  Listen to and/or record Everything
that is broadcasted live from 42 radio stations on Earth included with
this program.

The station list is available in XML from http://girl.software/girl.xml

A user without root on a GNOME desktop can add his or her Favourite
Stations in $HOME/.girl/girl.xml (see src/girl.xml for the syntax).

If a user starts the program and exits the program, then the last radio
station that the user was listening to, appears selected in the Stations
list.  The default girl Stations setting is stored in $HOME/.gnome2/girl

Enjoy Internet Radio.
