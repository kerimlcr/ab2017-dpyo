GNOME Internet Radio Locator runs on Debian GNU/Linux (http://www.debian.org/)
and Tarjei Tj√∏nn has written a build script for Debian-based systems available
from https://github.com/CaptainZalo/girl-installer/blob/master/install-girl.sh

If you are packaging GNOME Internet Radio Locator for Debian GNU/Linux and/or
other GNU/Linux distributions, please coordinate this with ole@src.gnome.org.
